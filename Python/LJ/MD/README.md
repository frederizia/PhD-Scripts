This folder contains files used for analysis of MD data. Currently:

viscosity_readlog.py - reads in LAMMPS log files and picks out the correct values, plots these and their fits
viscosity_readlog_compareJCP.py - reads in log files and data files containing literature data and plots these for comparison
