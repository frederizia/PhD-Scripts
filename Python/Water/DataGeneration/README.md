config_methods.py was amended by Frederike Jaeger to change the functionalisation on the graphene sheet edges (added COO, COOH, made sure COH was working) and to add a parameter determining the percentage of functionalisation.

graphene_sheet_gen.py was amended by FJ to include argparse parameters and facilitate the file structure of the generated input files.
